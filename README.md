# rock_paper_scissors

Rock, paper, scissors game. You vs. the computer for 5 rounds. Ties don't count.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

RECAP: Great recap of JavaScript basics. Fairly simple, but I made a couple of minor mistakes. These were as simple as swapping counters for computer and player. Tough to find as debugger is a little confusing.
